# Matrix-Computation-Sharing-and-Education
## Motivation 
After years of studying in Stanford, I realized the growing power of matrix computation which fueled most modern technology. There are many people like me with weak math background meanwhile struggled in the courses or research (e.g. Machine Learning, Optimization,  which are built upon a strong background of linear algebra.
