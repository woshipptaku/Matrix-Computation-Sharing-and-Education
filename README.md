# Matrix-Computation-Sharing-and-Education
## Motivation 
The human beings can only discretely handle the real world while it runs under the mechanism of continuity. Guided by the blueprint written in lanugage of calculus, the growing power of matrix computation has fueled most modern science and technology. From years of studying in Stanford, I noticed there are many people like me starting with weak math background meanwhile struggled in the courses or research (e.g. Machine Learning, Optimization, Parallel Computing, Digital Signal Processing) which are built upon a strong background of matrix computation techinques. Realizing the existance of such a huge potential community, I decided to build a learning hub from which the potential members could benefit and myself as well. 

## Plan
Inspired by the Stanford course Numerical Linear Algebra, I found an amazing reference: Matrix Computation written by Gene H. Golub and Charles F.Van Loan. Apologize for my short run of words, I quote directly from the book " *A mine of insight and information and a provocation to thought,
