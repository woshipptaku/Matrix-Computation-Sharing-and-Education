# Matrix-Computation-Sharing-and-Education
## Motivation 
### Continous & Discrete
The human beings can only discretely handle the real world while it runs under the mechanism of continuity. Guided by the blueprint written in lanugage of calculus, the growing power of matrix computation has fueled most modern science and technology. From years of studying in Stanford, I noticed there are many people like me starting with weak math background meanwhile struggled in the courses or research (e.g. Machine Learning, Optimization,Graph Theory, Parallel Computing, Digital Signal Processing) which are built upon a strong background of matrix computation techinques. Realizing the existance of such a huge potential community, I decided to build a learning hub from which the potential members could benefit and myself as well. 

### Main Source
Inspired by the Stanford course Numerical Linear Algebra, I found an amazing reference: Matrix Computation written by Gene H. Golub and Charles F.Van Loan, who are too prestigious to need introduction. Apologize for my short run of words, I quote directly from the book " *A mine of insight and information and a provocation to thoughtï¼šthe annotated bibilographies are helpful to those wishing to explore further. One could not ask for more, and the book should be considered a resounding success".* Personally speaking, I wish I could get in touch with this book in the first year in Stanford, but it is never too late to get started for me and all of you. 

## Implementation
### Book Materials
- **Chapter Notes**: Considering the math in the book is highly intense and concise, it happens often to me that the algorithm in the book are not so explicitly stated that I have to decompose and robustly prove it. Aside from showing the techniques used in the proof, I will also conclude their underlying philosophy for the purpose of reuse in the following chapters. Furthermore, a large amount of carefully organized supplementary materials will be given.  
- **Problems**: I assume this part interests current grad students most because it could play the same role as Chegg somehow. From my point of view, everyone nonetheless I suggest should try working it through first time by themselves because at least for me, it enhanced my understanding and led to a deep insight of chapter notes.  
- **Literature**: The copyright is a big concern even though I downloaded most literatures listed on the book when I held student status. I definitely trust you guys but redistribution of the propritary publication is still risky. I will write a summary of literature review featured on the supplmentatry materials related to each section instead. To take full advantage of these literatures, I will provide the extended application cases from the industry as much as possible. I believe the real world application could further motivate you guys and myself as well.  
- **Code**: The book lists a large number of repositories of numerical software such as GVL4 and Netlib. In spite of the open source packages, the lack of coding pactice in the problems is really likely to get you guys bored. Therefore, I will implement certain algorithms in Matlab whenever I found neccessray. In the same manner, coding implementations based on literature review are also worth trying. I hope more concrete industry implementation become available when our group grows up. 
- **Job Matching Up** We are going to provide a reasoning chain and evaluating and testing system from the matrix computation techinque to specific requirements of problems in the industry.   

### Community Interaction
- **Contribution** It is almost certainly confirmed that more and more people will get involved and contribute to this project in the forseen future while I am by myself at this moment. The first proposed management structure is the Wikipedia style that anyone can edit the profile but the modification has to be approved by admin group. 

- **Crossvalidate** Any updates should be crossvalidated and peer reviewed before handing into admin. 

- **Interanl Software Tool Box** This is a late game plan but we can think ahead. We need to build a tree structured knowledge graph that support smart searching and inference.

## Progress & Updates 
7/25 update
I just finished 90% of the work diccussed in the *Implementation* section for Chapter 1. It costs me an averege of 2 hours daily effort in about 2 months. I need 2 more weeks to convert my hand written notes, proof and pseudo code into a well formatted Latex version. In worst case scenario (no one else contribute, 12 Chapters, 2.5 months for each) , this project would take 30 months to finish, which is accidentally around my 30-year-old birthday. The Latex version would be uploaded soon.
